# cartel


It's just a prototype at the moment that does the following

- Set up a game board
- Shuffles and deals
- Allow player to drag into "valid" space, currently all buildings are free
- Adds Associates from building, with lots missing
- Draw cards from bankroll
- Allow pocket cards to be played and stored in state, just not displayed

Up next:
- Player actions
- Player turns
- Player switching
- Discard for payment
